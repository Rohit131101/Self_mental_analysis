      "\n",
      "I appreciate your courage in reaching out and sharing about your current emotional state and concerns. Let's summarize and delve a bit deeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Users Reported Symptoms**:  \n",
      "You've reported feelings of high anxiety levels, tendencies of self-harm, and self-detestation. This combination can be particularly heavy to bear and it's important that we are addressing this clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Possible Explanation**:  \n",
      "Excessive anxiety and self-hatred can often stem from an accumulation of stress and pressure, possibly associated with academic or personal expectations. These feelings can sometimes result in self-harm tendencies as an attempt to cope or gain control over emotional pain. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recommended Coping Strategies**:    \n",
      "It's very important to ensure safety first, so if your thoughts about self-harm continue, please reach out to a mental health crisis hotline immediately. Typically, they are available 24/7 and ready to provide immediate support. Aside from this, various strategies can help manage your feelings of anxiety and self-hatred:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Stay Connected**: Don't isolate yourself. Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or a support group. It's always good to have someone who can listen and provide comfort.\n",
      "   - **Mindfulness and Meditation**: This can be quite effective in managing anxiety. You can try simple breathing exercises or guided meditation apps. This can help you stay grounded in the present moment, easing your anxious thoughts.\n",
      "   - **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise not only promotes better physical health but also improved mental wellbeing. This could be as simple as a daily walk, engaging in a sport you like, or even yoga.\n",
      "   - **Self-Care**: It's important to take care of your basic needs. Eating a balanced diet, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and doing things you enjoy can make a significant difference in your mood and energy levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Encouragement and Next Steps**:   \n",
      "Rohan, it's very brave of you to reach out and share what you're dealing with. Remember, there's no need to navigate these feelings alone. I strongly recommend you seek assistance from a mental health professional who can provide you with ongoing therapy and support. It's okay not to be okay, and it's more than okay to seek help when you need it. You're doing just that and it's a big step towards getting better. Keep going. You're stronger than you think.\n",
